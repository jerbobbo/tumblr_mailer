    <p>
      How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
      since we last talked. I'm learning to code part-time at Fullstack Academy and it's been great so far.

      I'm blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
      Look at my most recent posts:
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].post_url %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk soon,<br>
